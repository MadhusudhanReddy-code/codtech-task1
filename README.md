Project Overview: Basic Calculator

Objective:

Create a simple command-line calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Features:

User Input:

Prompt the user to enter two numbers.
Ask the user to select an operation (add, subtract, multiply, divide).

Operations:

Perform the chosen arithmetic operation on the two numbers.
Handle basic validation (e.g., check for valid numbers, prevent division by zero).

Output:

Display the result of the operation to the user.
Include messages for invalid input and operations.

Implementation Steps:

Setup:

Create a Python script file (e.g., calculator.py).

Function Definitions:

Define functions for each operation: add(), subtract(), multiply(), divide().

User Interaction:

Use input() to get numbers and operation choice from the user.
Convert input strings to appropriate data types (e.g., float for numbers).

Error Handling:

Use try-except blocks to manage invalid input and division by zero.

Display Result:

Print the result in a user-friendly format.

Example Code:

Here's a basic implementation of the calculator:

Conclusion:

This basic calculator provides fundamental functionality for arithmetic operations and can be expanded with additional features (e.g., more complex calculations, a graphical user interface) in the future. The project serves as an excellent introduction to Python programming, user input handling, and error management.
